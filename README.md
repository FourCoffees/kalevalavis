# kalevalavis
Code for kalevalavis.com
This is a customisation of a data-created curve using d3.js. 

The Kalevala book is sampled and broken into chunks that are then checked for words that usually represent good or evil. 
(see data/good.text adn data/evil.txt). Based on which of the two (good or evil) are more predominant in that chunk of text
- the curve that drawn moves towards left or right. Technically the curve is a bezier curve (path) and the control points are 
modified accordingly.

More documentation will come..
